# New Eagle Raptor DBW (drive-by-wire) ROS interface

This repository contains a collection of ROS packages, which allow DBW kit developers to quickly implement a generic ROS node for interacting with the New Eagle Raptor controller.

This ROS1 repository is NOT under active development. New Eagle recommends using ROS2 repository raptor-dbw-ros2.

The current development branch is `master` and targets ROS `kinetic` and `melodic`.

ROS Kinetic: [![Build Status](http://build.ros.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Kdoc__pacifica_dbw_ros__ubuntu_xenial_amd64)](http://build.ros.org/job/Kdoc__pacifica_dbw_ros__ubuntu_xenial_amd64/)

ROS Melodic: [![Build Status](http://build.ros.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Kdoc__pacifica_dbw_ros__ubuntu_xenial_amd64)](http://build.ros.org/job/Kdoc__pacifica_dbw_ros__ubuntu_xenial_amd64/)

# Packages

* can_dbc_parser - module for handling everything related to translating CAN messages to ROS
* raptor_dbw_can - DBW CAN driver
* raptor_dbw_joystick_demo - a demo that allows you to use a game controller to interact with the DBW ROS node 
* raptor_dbw_joystick_speed_demo - a demo that allows you to use a game controller to interact with the DBW ROS node 
* raptor_dbw_msgs - DBW ROS message definitions
* raptor_dbw - ROS metapackage encapsulating the other packages in this group
* pdu - power distribution unit (PDU) driver. The PDU is a separate CAN-enabled device that's part of New Eagle's product line.
* pdu_msg - PDU ROS message definitions

# Installing and building
## Official Release
This repository is no longer being actively developed & will not be officially released.

## Building from source
While we are working on releasing these packages through the ROS buildfarm, you can build them from source using a catkin workspace and following these steps:

1. Create and initialize a new catkin workspace if you don't already have one. Instructions below assume the workspace was created in catkin_ws.
2. cd catkin_ws/src
3. git clone https://github.com/NewEagleRaptor/pacifica-dbw-ros.git
4. cd ..
5. catkin_make

# Usage

## Running the joystick demo

Prerequisites:
* a game controller compatible with the ROS [joy driver](http://wiki.ros.org/joy)
* a Kvaser CAN adapter

1. cd catkin_ws
2. source devel/setup.bash
3. roslaunch raptor_dbw_joystick_demo joystick_demo.launch
